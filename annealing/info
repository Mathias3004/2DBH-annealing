run annealing with 28 cores
mpirun -np 28 ./main_annealing input_annealing_m

run DMRG with 29 cores
mpirun -np 29 ./main_DMRG input_DMRG_m

run expectation values for middle site and save (all MPS from above were saved and are now loaded)
mpirun -np 29 ./main_expect_single_site *link_to_folder*

open jupyter for data analysis.ipynb

Make sure that DMRG and annealing MPS have same Fock space (bond dimension doesn't matter)
and that all time and J arrays are the same (which should be good if np is chosen well)
