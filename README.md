Annealing is studied in a 2D Bose-Hubbard model. Start from Fock initial state (all oscillators uniform occupation, typically 1) and raise tunneling J from 0 to a final value to reach superfluid state. Control parameter is the time scale of change, whcih determines whether you are in adiabatically anealing (remain in ground state) or not.
